# rps-input-box

Re-Created my other Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but used a input box instead of buttons.

All functionality is essentially the same, just created one event listener function added onto the submit button that does all the game logic

Other than the input type change that is all that was done.

ENJOY PLAYING THIS VERSION!
